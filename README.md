# 👋 Hi, I'm Vitor Hugo Jovanelli

Software Developer based in Portugal, focused on Java backend and full-stack web development.

## 🧠 About Me

I recently completed a Software Engineering & AI Bootcamp, where I built production-ready applications using Java, Spring MVC, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL in collaborative, deadline-driven environments.

Before transitioning into software development, I worked as a Customer Service Subject Matter Expert, where I helped increase CSAT from 40% to over 90% by analyzing data, improving processes, and supporting team performance. This experience strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving mindset, which I now apply to backend systems and scalable software design.
